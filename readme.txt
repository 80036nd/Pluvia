What is Pluvia (RetroSn0ws OS)
===============================
Pluvia allows you to untethered downgrade your iPhone 4 without SHSH blobs! 
It uses the iOS 7.1.2 iBoot exploit "De Rebus Antiquis" by @xerub and @dora2-iOS.

Beta 1 Limitations
==================
Only for Mac!
Only supports iPhone3,1. 
Only supports iOS 6.x, 7.0.4, and 7.0.6.
Can only jailbreak iOS 6.1.3

NOTE: 8GB iPhone 4's that shipped with iOS 6 can only run iOS 6 and newer, NOT iOS 4 or 5. This almost certainly can't be fixed.

How to use Pluvia
=================
Use the RetroSn0w app. Its as simple as that.
